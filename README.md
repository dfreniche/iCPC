## What is this?

## How to use ?

Due to restrictions in the App Store distribution guidelines, this program will never be available via regular app store download. So the only way to enjoy it is to download the source code and install it in your own device. 

- you'll need a Mac computer, running macOS 10.14 (or later)
- you need to install Xcode. Using Xcode 11.3.1 for this project. To install, download Xcode from the Mac App Store.
- once Xcode is installed, you'll need to download the source code for this project. You can do it using `git` from a Terminal or downloading a ZIP file with the latest version of the source code.
- Open the `.xcode` file and run it to your iPhone/iPad :)
- Image disks (.dsk) have to be send via iTunes
